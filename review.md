# Review

- Overall I would say the reproducibility of the project was good, **no need to change any lines**, but there was no way provided to get the packages used quickly. A .yml file would have been good.
- The code itself is clean, **nicely structured**, but it lacks comments and explanation, the meaning of the variables is not explained anywhere, and they are not self explanatory.
- There is **no commit history on GitHub**, every line of code was committed at once.
- The  readme.md is a bit lacking, there is nothing about the environment, and most importantly **there is no source to the dataset used.**
- License is missing, it would have been good to include  one.
